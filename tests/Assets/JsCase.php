 * This bundle's own javascript, run through the harness c975L/UiBundle ships.
 *
 * The whole of what a bundle has to declare is where its assets are: its controllers are then served
 * beside UiBundle's, the bare "@hotwired/stimulus" they import is rewritten towards the Stimulus vendored
 * there, and a scenario reads back what they made of the DOM. Any bundle depending on c975L/UiBundle
 * writes exactly this class and nothing more.
